dear %s,

i am happy to invite you to my november party saturday the 23.

as in the past, we will be loads of cool people with lots of hot topics to discuss, have a big hot bonfire outside in the cool autumn night and loads of cool music with hot rhythms inside.

i am looking forward to other creative contributions as well, especially idea that motivate and connect us with each other.

no presents, please!

you are welcome to contribute something edible to the buffet, own dance music, and anything else you enjoy that enhances the bliss of all sentient beings, especially you yourself and your good mood.

beverages of all kinds are provided.

please feel free to arrive whenever you like, including during the daytime. coffee, tea, cakes etc. is all sitting and waiting for you.

there is no fixed starting time, and it is possible to stay the night.

you are also welcome to arrive on friday, e.g. if you come from far away, would like to help prepare, spend a bit more time together, or whatever. visitors from afar can also secure some privacy by checking into the hotel next door, huenerbergweg 26, 79539 Loerrach, 07621/2066, well recommended.

i am also celebrating a sweat lodge on sunday november 24, relaxed and spritual... it lasts from noon until midnight, more or less. in case of interest, please register quickly, since we are a limited number.

i wish you a wonderful autumn.

best regards,

jeremy
